	<dl>Pulp Fiction</dl>
	<dd> It is an 2hour action packed, multiscripted movie that shows the audience not all bad guys are bad. Sometimes its just business</dd>
	
		<dl>Kill Bill Vol 1&2</dl>
	<dd>Kill Bill is the first movie I can remember watching from Tarantino's collection. I loved how he took the Gorge Lucus approch in putting out the movies backwards, first vol 2 and then vol 1. I also really liked Lucy Lus story line and how he chose to put into a comic book style. You really do get that ninja vibe after her life story.</dd>
	
	<dl>Once Upon a Time in Holloywood</dl>
	<dd>I just went to go see this one this past weekend, so I'll try not to give out too much. <b>BUT</b> I will say it is definetly one of my favorites. I was a little confused for a bit but in true Tarantino fashion he really brought it all home at the end. It is a very well multicripted movie with multipule paradoxes both within the movie and with his characters.</dd>
